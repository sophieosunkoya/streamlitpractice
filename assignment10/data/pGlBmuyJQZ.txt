Barnaby The Bears my name, never call me Jack or James, I will sing my way to fame, Barnaby the Bears my name. Birds taught me to sing, when they took me to their king, first I had to fly, in the sky so high so high, so high so high so high, so  if you want to sing this way, think of what youd like to say, add a tune and you will see, just how easy it can be. Treacle pudding, fish and chips, fizzy drinks and liquorice, flowers, rivers, sand and sea, snowflakes and the stars are free.
